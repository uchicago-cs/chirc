class SingleIRCSession:
    '''
    Class used to manage an IRC session involving a single server.
    At the start of the session, the server is started and we can connect
    to it with one or more clients (which are constructed through this class).
    The class also includes methods to perform common IRC actions (e.g.,
    sending a message from one user to another, joining a channel, etc.)
    and verifying that they were performed correctly.
